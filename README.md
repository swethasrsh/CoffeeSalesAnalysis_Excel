**Dataset:**
The dataset contains retail sales data from the Coffee Shop, including transaction details such as date, time, location, product details, and sales amount.

**Data Cleaning:**
Utilized Power Query to split product details to size, added conditional column to size, and included columns for month, day of the week, and hour from transaction date and time respectively. Used Power Query functions to implement these transformations.

**Analysis:**
Utilized pivot tables to calculate the how do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day, the best selling products also did product category analysis. Used charts such as line chart, bar and pie chart to visualise this analysis.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the analysis provides valuable insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance. 

Start Your Day With Coffee: Analyzed sales variation by day of the week and hour of the day to identify peak sales times.

The analysis shows that the order quantity starts relatively high at hour 6, reaches a peak around hour 8, and then steadily declines until hour 20. The overall trend is a downward curve, suggesting that order quantities decrease as the hours progress throughout the day or time period represented on the x-axis.

Location Analysis: Explored sales variations across different store locations.
The analysis shows the sum of total bills (sales revenue) and transaction counts across three store locations: Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan. Lower Manhattan has the highest sales and transaction volumes, followed by Hell's Kitchen and then Astoria. The sales figures are significantly higher than the transaction counts for all locations, indicating larger average order sizes.

Bestselling Products: Identified the bestselling products in terms of both quantity and revenue.
The analysis suggests that the "Ethiopia" and "Jamaican Coffee River" products are the top-selling varieties, while "Brazilian" and "Latte" have relatively lower sales. The "Sustainably Grown Organic" category also seems to perform better than these two categories but lower than the top two sellers.
Product Category Analysis: Examined sales variations by product category and type.

The analysis highlights the dominance of coffee and tea products in terms of sales contribution, with coffee being the most significant revenue generator. The bakery items also account for a notable share of sales. However, the branded products, chocolates, loose tea, and flavors seem to have relatively smaller contributions to the overall sales distribution.
